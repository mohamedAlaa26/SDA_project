# SDA Project â€“ Service Provider System

This project follows **SOLID principles** and **Clean Architecture** for designing a service provider platform.


## ðŸ”§ Principles Used

- **S â€“ Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):**  
  A class should have only one reason to change â€“ it should do one thing only.

- **O â€“ Open/Closed Principle (OCP):**  
  Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

- **L â€“ Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):**  
  Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.

- **I â€“ Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):**  
  Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.

- **D â€“ Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):**  
  High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
